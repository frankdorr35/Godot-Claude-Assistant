# Godot Assisstant
Godot Engine plugin for Claude API.
Use Claude API in the docked window to collaborate in Godot. This provides detailed information about each file, including its size, and for GDScript files, the number of methods. For scene files, it counts the number of nodes. There are buttons for create file and edit file as well, more updates coming. API key can be entered in claude_assistant.gd.
